# 🚨 Predicting Insurance Claim Fraud with Snowflake & Cortex AI

## 📊 Problem Statement

Insurance fraud costs the industry billions annually. This project aims to detect potentially fraudulent claims using historical insurance data and AI-powered analysis directly inside Snowflake.

## 🧠 Solution

We leverage **Snowflake Cortex AI** for fraud prediction on structured claims data, using Python and interactive dashboards for analysis and insights.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Snowflake** (Snowpark, Cortex AI, UDFs)
- **Python**
- **Snowsight** / **Streamlit** for visualization
- **dbt** (optional, for modular SQL transformations)
